This is not the first of it's kind of post on this blog. I have migrated in the past from [Blogspot](rahulpnath.blogspot.com) to [Wordpress.com](rahulpnath.wordpress.com), then to [self-hosted Wordpress](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-web-sites-moving-wordpress-to-cloud/). 

It didn't end there though, I moved it again to a Static generator.

No, not Hugo. Not there yet!

I moved it to [Octopress](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/static-generator-is-all-a-blog-needs-moving-to-octopress/) and from there finally to [Hugo](https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/migrating-octopress-to-hugo/). 

But wait, that was not final. I moved again, just now - Where? 

To **Gatsby**

Good that I blog about other things as well in between. Otherwise this blog would just be about migrating from one platform to another. 

For those who are not familiar with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), it is a free open sourced framework based on React and helps to build websites and apps. 

## The Main Contenders

If you follow me on [twitter](twitter.com/rahulpnath), you will know that the main reason for moving away is that it is painfully slow to get anything done with 

I have been wanting to add more features to this blog like adding in a landing page newsletter, email subscription form, set up related articles etc. Doing all these felt painfully slow with Hugo - especially because I am not much familiar with Go programming language and the hugo templating engine. Over the past one and half year with Hugo, I had learned just enough to make minor adjustments and tweaks to keep the blog running. I did not find much incentive to learn Go programming language and so I wanted to migrate.

I really didn't want to migrated to another Static generator site and Gatsby was not my natural first choice.

I wanted to migrate to a hosted service like Squarespace, where I would not have to bothere anything about hosting, managing services for newsletter, configuring a landing page etc. It is all click and configure or drag and drop design.
